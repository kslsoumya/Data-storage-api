Implement a small HTTP service in Node.js to store objects organized by repository.
Clients of this service should be able to `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` objects.

## General Requirements

* The service should de-duplicate data objects by repository.
* The included tests should pass and not be modified. Adding additional tests is encouraged.
* The service should implement the API as described below.
* The data can be persisted in memory, on disk, or wherever you like.
* External dependencies can be used, but are not required.
